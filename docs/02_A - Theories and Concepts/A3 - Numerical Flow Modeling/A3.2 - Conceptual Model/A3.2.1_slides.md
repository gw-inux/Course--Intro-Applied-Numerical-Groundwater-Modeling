Example: Area intended for groundwater extraction
Interaction of ground- and surface water
Additional: Airport (lower left part) with possible impact on groundwater quality

##### Model results: Pathlines (showing the well catchment area) and drawdown isocontour lines)

##### Deriving a suitable conceptual model is the next step once the question / purpose of modeling is clear

##### Figure represents an first example of an conceptual model (illustration / qualitative functioning etc.)

##### See the questions marks in the figure: the conceptual model also identifies uncertainties

##### One criterion for model classification distinguishes the qualitative from the quantitative description of a real system.

##### A conceptual model provides a qualitative representation of the relevant system components, processes and impacts in the area of investigation.

##### This representation is often shown graphically, e.g. as block model (see below), horizontal or vertical cross sections.

##### Descriptive representation of groundwater system incorporating interpretation of geological & hydrological conditions

##### What processes are important to model?

##### What are the boundaries?

##### What parameter values are available?

##### What parameter values must be collected?

##### This abstract from Bredehoeft (2005) highlights the importance of the conceptual model

##### The conceptual model represents the current state of knowledge

##### With more data, the conceptual model can change in the future
